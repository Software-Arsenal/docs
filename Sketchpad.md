consider the starting place to be an android app built for a **Retail Store**. What all backend components will it need?
- A way to define Object / Item 
- A way to define transaction (buy / sell)
- A ledger
- A way to define inventory
- A way to define Staff (might not be needed in bare-bones version)

Once we have components built, we need a way to build the app on top of components
- each component should be treatable as an interface, the user can extend interface to add functionality
-
